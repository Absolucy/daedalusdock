changes:
  - qol: Redid how space cash works because it was too annoying to play with. Large
      bills do exist but are intended to be difficult to obtain and mostly for flair.
      Space Cash now stacks up to 500, and is mostly given out in 1's.
  - qol: Put FAR too much effort into making item stacks look prettier.
  - qol: Item stacks now display the amount in the stack as a number on the sprite
      if you are holding it.
