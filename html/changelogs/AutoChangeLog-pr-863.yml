changes:
  - balance: Many objects that were previously borderline indestructible to players
      are now destructible. Most notably, Airlocks and Firedoors can now be destroyed
      with weapons as strong as a wrench. It will take a while though.
  - balance: Firedoor health reduced substantially.
  - rscadd: You can now shimmy through airlock assemblies by clicking on them with
      an empty hand.
