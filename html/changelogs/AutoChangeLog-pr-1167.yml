changes:
  - rscadd: Silver Sulfadiazine, a fast-acting but inefficient topical burn healing
      reagent.
  - rscadd: Styptic Powder, a fast-acting but inefficient topical brute healing reagent.
  - bugfix: Fixed coagulant effects causing errors.
  - balance: Doubled the metabolization rates of Dermaline and Meralyne. I felt they
      weren't impactful enough for how annoying they are to make.
