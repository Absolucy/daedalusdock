  - rscadd: Maint Slugs! They leave behind a slippery trail and can be "milked" if
      so desired. Cargo starts with a unique one.
  - rscadd: Feral Hogs! Technically a neutral animal, they become aggressive if you
      get too close. Security has a private hog.
  - rscdel: Sgt. Araneus and Paperwork have been sent off to kindly old spaceman's
      farm, where they will happily live out the rest of their natural lives.
