changes:
  - rscadd: Station Time now shows the station's canonical date.
  - rscadd: Station name, date, and time, are displayed in a sick cool epic way on
      round join.
  - rscadd: The station's time is now randomly offset between 0 and 23 hours.
  - bugfix: A ton of timezone related garbage. Nightshift should notably work properly.
  - rscdel: The splashscreen fade was removed because it causes a bug that makes planes
      freak out.
