changes:
  - balance: Damaging a bodypart with a broken bone has a chance to deal damage to
      an organ inside.
  - balance: Damage that ignores armor (such as pressure damage) can no longer break
      bones or jostle bones.
  - balance: Tweaked the dismemberment formula for the 8th time
  - code_imp: Removed organ/var/status
